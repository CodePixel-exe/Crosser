# Crosser
A college project I had developed for a class in app development on a previous course. The game makes use of Python and the Pygame module library. 
The game features a controllable car and a hazard to avoid which are pedestrians.
The main aim of the game is that it is and endless verticle scroller with the intent of getting as high of a score as possible.

If the car hits a pedestrian, game over.
